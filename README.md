# Molecule-simulator
Python Pygame developed Chemistry Simulator that allows you to simulate the reactions between different elements and molecules.
The simulator uses a matching recipe to determine whether the elements or molecules can bond with each other, and bonding only occurs if the temperature conditions are right. You can also change the states of the molecules by changing the temperature.

How to use: To spawn a mol of an element, click the left mouse button. To add more to that dot, hold the mouse button down. To switch to a new element, right-click. The elements are in order of atomic number. To change the temperature, click the slider in the top left corner to move it. Temperature is displayed in 3 different units.

Purpose: The "Molecule Simulator" is designed to be a fun toy/tool to help people interested in chemistry understand basic reactions and the temperatures at which those reactions need to occur. The simulator shows how a Particle Collision Theory works.  It can be used to explore and experiment with different chemical reactions and to learn about molar volume and the properties of different states of matter.
